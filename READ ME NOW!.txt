Hello whoever you are (probably Jonas)
Yes, this is in fact a public github repo without a custom domain name, I couldn't figure it out, dont feel like spending money, and kinda forgot that litteraly anybody can access this page.
While I must congratulate you for thinking about checking this, if you would kindly turn back and forget anything you saw on the previous page that would be great.
Looking for clues via poking around in here isn't apart of any intended solution, and may invalidate a significat part of the puzzles.

I dont want you to leave empty handed so uuuuh, idk here's a cookie: 🍪
